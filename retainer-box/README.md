My daughter has a retainer. The orthodontist provided her with an
enormous plastic case to place them whenever she needed to remove it
for eating. She isn't permitted her purse or backpack at lunch, so it
was annoying to carry the case around.

The retainer module parameterizes the size of the individual retainer,
and produces a clamshell box that is as small as possible while still
safely holding the retainer.

This uses my first ever design of print-in-place hinges, and it's
taken a number of iterations to really get those dialed in. I've found
they work perfectly in PLA at 0.15mm layer height, no special layer
settings needed.
