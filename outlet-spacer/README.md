Fits over a single-gang metal mount outlet box. Acts as a spacer for
cases where part of the box may protrude past drywall. The last 1mm of
the depth of the spacer has a small lip which allows the actual outlet
or toggle to capture the spacer and pull it tight to the wall.

Made this because one of my basement outlets protruded (crookedly) 8mm
from the wall. Normal covers would end up "floating" and things tended
to get caught in that gap.
